  - Added attribute validation with exceptions to Role::ACL constructor.
  - Action must include at least one RequiresRole or AllowedRole attribute or an exception will result.
  - Added mandatory "ACLDetachTo" attribute, names action to which request is detached on ACL violation.
  - Removed tests against "unreachable" action, since actions without ACLs now generate exceptions.
